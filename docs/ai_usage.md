-explain how to sort odd integers from a numerical range from 5 to 27
-![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
Use Python's range() function to create numbers from 5 to 27:
range(5, 28)  # 28 because the stop value is exclusive
Use a list comprehension to get only numbers where num % 2 == 1:
odd_numbers = [num for num in range(5, 28) if num % 2 == 1]
